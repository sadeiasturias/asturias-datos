# Open SDG - Data starter

This is a starter repository to help in implementing the [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) platform. [See here for documentation](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io).

Remark that only the metadata file (e.g. the .md file) is needed in order to automatically generate the corresponding indicator page. If there are no data available for that indicator, the corresponding data file (e.g. the .csv) need not be included, and the indicator page behaviour (i.e. whether the chart and table are generated) can be set via the `reporting_status` meta field.
